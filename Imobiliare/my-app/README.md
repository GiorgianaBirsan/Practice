<h1>Real Estate</h1>

<p>This application is about adding new rents or real estate to be sold.</p>
<p>I created this project using <em>ReactJS</em> and styling with <em>ChakraUI.</em></p>

<p>It's a very simple application opened with a click button which also opens a modal form to add the details about the rent. The user has to complete the inputs or select options from the dropdown menu, but also upload an image of the apartment.</p>

<p>After rendering the ad, the creator has the possibility to edit or delete the ad from the list. This is all stocked in Json Blob</p>
