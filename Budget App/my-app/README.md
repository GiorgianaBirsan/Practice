<h1>Budget App</h1>

<p>This project represents a SPA money flow tracker created with ReactJS.
  
From the beginning, the user has to create a wallet via a modal form, and then have some predefined categories of transaction, but it can also be added a custom category from a similar modal form as the wallet form, from the left side of the page.</p>

<p> This is all needed to create a new log transaction in the History. On the right side of the page, the user triggers another modal form where can create the transaction with all details that are helping him to track his money over time.</p>

<p>On the top of the list of transactions, it's calculated the total amount of expenses and the total amount of income from all categories and all wallets existing.</p>

<p>For the moment, in the list of transactions, the user can only filter by category and delete transactions.</p>
